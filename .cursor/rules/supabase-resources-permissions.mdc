Rule: For any required Supabase resource creation (e.g., buckets, policies, tables, columns, rows), ASK FOR APPROVAL. Provide the necessary details for manual creation.

Rule: DO NOT write code that circumvents the need for Supabase setup for features requiring database interaction.


Rule: Prioritize creating missing tables, rows, or columns in Supabase over modifying scripts to remove them. Only remove missing items from scripts if they are definitively not required for functionality.
