Based on the ${trades.length} trades analyzed, here are the key patterns identified:

### Strengths
- Your overall win rate is ${winRate.toFixed(1)}%, ${winRate > 50 ? 'showing consistent profitability' : 'which needs improvement'}
- ${bestPair !== 'Unknown' ? `Your trades on ${bestPair} show the highest win rate at ${bestWinRate.toFixed(1)}%` : 'No specific currency pair shows consistent outperformance'}
- Your ${bestTimeframe} trades perform better, with a ${bestTimeframe === 'morning' ? morningWinRate.toFixed(1) : afternoonWinRate.toFixed(1)}% win rate

### Areas for Improvement
- ${worstPair !== 'Unknown' ? `Consider reducing exposure to ${worstPair} which shows a lower win rate of ${worstWinRate.toFixed(1)}%` : 'No specific currency pair shows consistent underperformance'}
- ${winningTrades.length > 0 ? "There's a pattern of early exits on winning trades that could be extended" : "Focus on developing a consistent entry and exit strategy"}
- ${trades.length > 10 ? "Your position sizing could be more consistent based on account balance fluctuations" : "Build more trade history to identify clearer patterns"}

### Recommendations
1. ${bestPair !== 'Unknown' ? `Focus on ${bestPair} where your performance is strongest` : 'Concentrate on major pairs with higher liquidity'}
2. Consider trading more during the ${bestTimeframe} hours when your success rate is higher
3. Implement a trailing stop strategy to maximize winning trades
4. ${worstPair !== 'Unknown' ? `Review your strategy for ${worstPair} or consider avoiding it` : 'Maintain consistent position sizing relative to your account balance'}

This analysis is based on your recent trading performance and current market conditions. For best results, combine these insights with fundamental analysis and risk management techniques.`);
